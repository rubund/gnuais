# ALSA sound device name or "pulse" for pulseaudio,
# If alsa is used: either the name of the card (default for the
# first / default card), or a device name, for example: hw:2,0 for the first
# input of the third card.
SoundDevice default

# Which sound channels to decode:
#   both
#       - ask the sound card for a stereo signal and decode both channels
#       - a good default, if you're not sure which channel your receiver is in
#   mono
#       - ask the sound card for a single mono channel
#       - needed for a true mono card, like some USB audio sticks, which only
#         have a single audio input channel
#   left
#       - ask the sound card for a stereo signal and only decode the
#         left channel
#   right
#       - ask the sound card for a stereo signal and decode the right channel
#
SoundChannels both

# Print sound peak level information in the log every N seconds.
# The input level should be around 70-90% - if it's 100% the signal is too loud
# and distorted. Tune your mixer settings. Comment the line out, or set to 0,
# to disable level logging below distortion levels.

# Print receiver range statistics in the log every N seconds.
# StatsInterval defines the logging interval. Latitude and Longitude of the
# receiver are given in decimal degrees (not degrees and minutes, or seconds).
# Positive values for northern latitude and eastern longitude, negative
# values for southern latitude and western longitude.
#StatsInterval 10
#Latitude 35.2512
#Longitude 110.8175

# AIS data uplink configuration - received APRS data will be posted here

# Serial port for AIS export - NMEA sentences will be written here after
# decoding. Currently it is not possible to read AIS data from an
# AIS receiver connected to a serial port.
